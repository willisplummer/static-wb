<b>A Lifelike Tennis</b><br><br>

Dealer deals entire deck.<br>
Player to dealer’s left is Angler.<br>
Player to Angler's left is Fish.<br>
Player to Fish's left (dealer’s right) is Cormorant.<br><br>

Dealer then becomes Ghost.<br>
Ghost holds cards facing the other players.<br>
Other players hold their cards facing themselves.<br>
Fish and then Ghost play first, one card each.<br><br>

The difference between cards' values is the Net.<br>
(Ace = 1, numbers = themselves, Jack = 11, Queen = 12, King = 13)<br>
Next Angler and then Cormorant each play a card.<br>
If the card played is higher than the Net, that player gets a point.<br><br>

The difference between their cards forms the new Net<br>
For Fish and then Ghost who each play another card.<br>
As before, if the card clears the Net, a point is awarded.<br>
If played cards match, each player gets two points<br><br>

Regardless of whether the card clears the Net.<br>
Play continues until all cards have been played.<br>
Player with most points wins hand.<br>
Ties are won by player farthest (clockwise) from Ghost.<br><br>

Ghost wins count for two hands. (Optional variant:<br>
Cormorant can choose to become a Ghost<br>
Any time the number of cards in her hand<br>
Exceeds her current number of points.<br><br>

To do this, she turns cards face outwards.<br>
Ghost can not turn back into Cormorant.<br>
If Cormorant chooses to become a Ghost<br>
But does not go on to win the hand,<br><br>

She loses one hand from her total.)<br>
Before each new hand, Angler becomes new Ghost,<br>
Fish becomes new Angler, and so on. First player<br>
To reach a given number of hands wins.
