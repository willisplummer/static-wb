<b>Racquetballism</b><br><br>

Dealer deals out five cards to each of four players.<br>
Player to dealer's right is Racquetballist and holds her cards facing herself.<br>
Dealer and other players are Ghosts and hold their cards facing out.<br>
Object of game is to draw long strands (as of spaghetti)<br><br>

From the racquetball court which contains them.<br>
Strands are made only of complete sentences.<br>
Spades are verbs. Royalty of all other suits<br>
Are conjunctions. Remaining clubs are nouns.<br><br>

Remaining diamonds are adjectives. Remaining hearts<br>
Are wild cards which can fill any grammatical slot<br>
As chosen by Racquetballist. Any Ghost can veto wild card choice;<br>
If a veto is declared, the card is lost and the turn is over.<br><br>

One veto per Ghost per hand. Play commences to dealer's left<br>
And continues clockwise. The rest of the rules are<br>
That most often the sentence will not form<br>
Since this is not communication with the dead<br><br>

But the great mediated asymmetrical common endeavor.<br>
Racquetballist must convey to each Ghost the degree of hollowness.<br>
The sound of the hollow ball struck as hard as possible<br>
Seems to come from everywhere, a very enclosed everywhere,<br><br>

Though recently the mapping of baseline hollowness onto sentences was deprecated<br>
But yet somehow a mapping of real world activities onto game actions via sentences<br>
Is exemplary of the lyrical impulse and so is grandfathered or outright exonerated.<br>
A complete sentence will usually not form under these conditions.
