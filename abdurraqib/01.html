It is 3:15 on a Saturday &amp; I am in a car on I-95 on the way to the soccer game &amp; Nate is riding shotgun which is also the name for when you plunge something sharp into a can of beer &amp; split open its aluminum shell before swallowing its urgent sacrifice &amp; I once saw Nate do this five times in one night before the Mount Union game &amp; we got to the field late the next morning smelling like something coughed up in the heat of a 1980’s summer &amp; it was almost as hot then as it is right now in this traffic that isn’t moving &amp; hasn’t moved for what feels like thirty years which is to say that it feels like we haven’t moved since we were too small to speak &amp; burden everyone we love with our refusal to crawl back into silence &amp; every car on this highway is in park &amp; somehow people are still pressing on their horns &amp; Nate turns up the radio &amp; David Ruffin is singing <i>I wish it would rain </i>&amp; his voice is unfolding long &amp; slow in the backseat like an eager lover &amp; there is a whole history of men demanding the sky to shake at their command &amp; I’m not saying out loud whether or not I believe in god &amp; I’m not saying out loud what I know the rain means I’m only saying that I need this dry summer to stay dry I’m only saying that the tickets to this soccer game cost as much as my best suit &amp; kickoff is at 3:30 &amp; we are absolutely going to be late &amp; there is a whole history of black people being late to things &amp; there is a whole language signaling our arrival &amp; there is an entire catalog of jokes that dissect this happening &amp; they never get old &amp; by <i>they </i>I mean <i>black people in America</i> &amp; I can hear the joke our college soccer coach made when the only two black boys on the team stumbled late onto a hot field &amp; lateness always makes for a good joke &amp; the punchline is I slept through my mother’s final breaths or the punchline is I stumbled into a living room thick with a family’s grief while clearing a night’s salt from my eyes or the punchline is that I’m always running late I’m always running I’m always trying to move time backwards &amp; tell everyone that I love them &amp; isn’t that funny &amp; Nate points to an ambulance speeding down the highway opposite us &amp; disappearing into the sun &amp; I don’t want to think that there might be a body inside of it &amp; then all of the cars start moving</span></p>
