<b>Don’t text back if he’s in your bed</b><br><br>

even if he’s traveled to a palace there are no directions to<br>
and his arms clutch his pillow <br>
and his big hands dangle needlessly over his shoulder<br>
while you decide your outfits for the trip<br>
does he mind how you covet your phone?<br>
does he care how you dress?<br>
like an embarrassed tomboy gone heavy on the makeup<br>
do you like him better than Aaron?<br>
does he have a stance?<br>
could his face fill a movie poster?<br>
Annie already told me about him<br>
he sounds like a career man who talks endlessly about the sea<br>
and the Jewish summer camp he was fired from<br>
someone who will build you a fire<br>
and then critique the fire<br>
this guy at the tavern was driving me crazy last night<br>
after you left I felt like, I don’t know<br>
don’t worry about me<br>
I’ve been chatting with a jewel prince in Qatar<br>
no, seriously<br>
I’ve been spending time on all my little projects<br>
I’ve decided to never start a business<br>
don’t text me if there’s anyone there<br>
really<br>
remember what happened with Aaron?<br>
Aaron hated me<br>
it was a pretend friendship so we could both be near you<br>
since you’re so funny sometimes<br>
you don’t think he can hear the phone?<br>
I bet he’s slovenly like an aging gym teacher<br>
just kidding, Annie says he’s decent looking<br>
but not her type<br>
she goes for those narrow swimmer shaped boys<br>
like yellow wooden pencils<br>
and she likes mustaches<br>
I’m not making this up<br>
I learned too much about her<br>
by mistake<br>
at the tavern last night<br>
people thought we were lesbians and it horrified her<br>
I could just tell<br>
and you were probably having good sex<br>
I looked at my watch and could almost see you having it<br>
with this new guy<br>
who you met Online!<br>
don’t think I forgot that part<br>
my phone is filling up<br>
my poor phone<br>
you should see how the AT&amp;T guys treat me<br>
like a blind peasant who’s wandered in from the past<br>
they act so superior to me and my Pantech<br>
that’s the model<br>
I should fuck some sense into them<br>
just kidding, I would never sleep with an AT&amp;T person<br>
I would entrap them though<br>
I would taunt them from a moving car<br>
hey<br>
have fun on the trip<br>
think of me<br>
painting bird houses at the factory<br>
analyzing Jason’s blog<br>
evading Annie at the tavern<br>
looking in my watch for you
