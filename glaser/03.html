<b>I wonder who my therapist lives with if not just her husband</b><br><br>

has she a wife too?<br>
or do her sisters stay in the room over the garage<br>
has she taken in some lonely youths who reject their own given parents<br>
or kids from the mountains, trained by the sky and unschooled?<br>
has she wild sex with many partners in the special room Loyisa painted<br> 
on the loveseat under Andrew’s elk head?<br>
is it the kind of colony where the same thought travels around the table?<br>
is it a camp, like mine in summer, where classical music pours into the<br> outdoors and people lay about in the grass?<br>
have I thought my life so dissented from the norm since I sometimes don’t<br> bother with a bra or leave my house or receive a salary<br>
when actually it is she who lives a mystery and is maybe making more jokes?<br>
does she shake with laughter around the fire<br>
swaying next to a traveler who stays for just one night?<br>
when arriving home, (I see a wooden sign swinging over a long dirt path)<br>
does she immediately shed her sensible clothes and don a robe with her name?<br>
I wonder<br> 
in these days between sessions<br>
recalling again how when I asked, carefully, if it were just she and her<br> husband living like one, she stared at me, one eye off nowhere, and then said “no,”<br>
and it thrilled me<br>
and thrills me still<br>
though each remembrance a little less<br>
as I accept it as fact<br>
but at a minute like this one<br>
is she picking up her skirts?<br>
is she choosing between Pedro and Adrianna<br>
or tying a headdress on her son?<br>
has she found the right way to live?<br>
free from her television?<br>
has God shown her how to stay beautiful<br>
no matter what ugliness boils the world<br>
will she press the magic into my palm?<br>
in the form of an appointment card<br>
will she draft my lifestyle<br>
and make it less frivolous<br>
make it roll harmoniously<br>
avoiding the dullness and the bother<br>
the pettiness we all room with?<br>
will she be dancing at my wedding<br>
or pushing me into her car<br>
and driving<br>
to the house she built with Omar<br>
the place with no address<br>
but a jingle they all sing<br>
or a nickname<br>
The Houseboat<br>
or Cloud 8?
