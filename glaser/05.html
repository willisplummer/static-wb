<b>Guitar Teacher</b><br><br>

the girl loves the guitar teacher but loves everything<br>
but especially, that summer<br>
the guitar teacher<br>
whose life has beaten him into teaching guitar<br>
in second floor music stores<br>
the dim underground of suburban homes<br>
in the grass like a god<br>
or someone who’s seen god<br><br>

guitar teachers don’t have good clothes<br>
their heroes haven’t really helped them<br>
and stare from album covers<br>
while the guitar teachers sigh<br>
and strum<br>
and summon youth<br>
and conjure the feeling of wisdom<br>
walking the gritty parts of the city<br>
or parts that used to be gritty<br>
but now are maybe just worn and dead<br><br>

the notes<br>
there is something clear in the notes<br>
guitar teachers lay beside their acoustic<br>
thinking the guitar is man’s best invention<br>
a more honest woman<br>
or an obedient protégé<br><br>

the girl makes the guitar teacher feel old<br>
but occasionally legendary<br>
she holds her little music book<br>
though she refuses theory<br>
she wants to learn a Doors song and he laughs<br>
the song is all bass<br>
but he figures it out for her<br>
remembering a dream he had<br>
just the night before<br>
he was dancing with the girl<br>
while a boy watched them<br>
burning<br>
a boy that didn’t play the guitar<br>
or even own one<br>
a boy who didn’t have a voice<br>
at least not a singing voice<br><br>

eventually the guitar teacher backed away<br>
and let the boy try to dance<br>
the girl was, of course<br>
in the very highlight of her life<br>
like a sea creature shimmering in the sun<br>
the guitar teacher has been tracking this light<br>
this growing understanding of her own freedom<br>
inside and outside a guitar solo<br>
the wandering song that led the guitar teacher out of his parents house<br>
and into the exciting, gritty parts of town<br>
into the arms of girls who liked the Doors<br>
liked Jim Morrison<br>
though no guitar teacher really loves Jim Morrison<br>
no good guitar teacher<br><br>

the girl isn’t very different than those girls<br>
has the same wild laugh<br>
has taken the idea of a hippie and ran with it<br>
with scarfs and lamps<br>
and the poems of Charles Bukowski<br>
the guitar teacher wants to show the girl sex<br>
how it was shown to him<br>
but she is dancing with the boy<br>
and her light is blinding
