   <p>Mary took the bus downtown to meet Dana at Water, a bar with lime green walls, fiberglass floors and lots of modern furniture.</p><br>

<p>Dana, drunk on Grey Goose, rummaged through her purse and pulled out the card of a campus therapist. Dana said Mary had a problem with men and a poor sense of self-worth.   Later, Mary explained the conversation to Pat. She spoke in a slow, clear voice, as if she were issuing a warning.</p><br>

<p><em>–She said my neck is getting fat<br>
–That another chin is forming.<br>
–She said my hair makes me look like a dyke.<br>  
–She said that I’d never find love because I like black men.<br> 
– She said I'm faking it in school because I don't really know what to do with my life.<br>
–She said I'm stupid for going to see Marco. That he hasn't changed a bit.<br>
 –She said being a whore isn’t progressive or interesting, it’s just being a whore.<br>
–Well...  She says you won't last a week</em></p><br>

<p>Pat shook his head to show her he disagreed.</p><br>

<p>With Dana being Irish too, Pat assumed a sense of national sisterhood bound her to Mary. He had no real opinion of Dana, other than thinking nothing should be that cruel or white. But now Dana served a purpose, bring her up and Mary comes back.</p><br>

<p><em>–Why didn’t Dana come?<br>
–She said she didn’t want to see a movie about whores.<br>
–Does she not know?<br>
–I’ve stopped being an escort. Can’t be bothered.</em></p><br>
 
<p>She relaxed her shoulders and staked both armrests.</p><br>

<p><em>–What will you do for money?<br>
–I still have my grant money. I’m working at the university library.</em></p> <br>

<p>The lights dimmed and their faces lit up blue.</p>
