   <p>They were lying in her bed, talking about a professor who had touched her breast. She made scoffing noises through her nose. Pat called the professor a piece of shit, then the conversation lulled. They listened to Brenton Wood's <em>I’m The One Who Knows</em>. They started whistling the song together, playfully knocking feet. On impulse, Pat ran his fingertips over the scars on her forearm and asked:</p><br>

<p><em>–Where did these come from?</em></p><br>

<p>Mary raised her arm slowly and wiped at the scars three times, hard and quick like she was trying to brush them away.  She sat up and made a fart sound with her mouth. Pat, who took the fart sound personally, wondered if he was prying: they’d only been seeing each other for a week. She told him about Marco.</p><br>

<p><em>–My ex. He did it. I mean, I did it, but he did it.</em></p><br>

<p>She giggled nervously and made another fart sound.</p><br>
  
<em><p>–So why are you staying in New York with this guy?<br>
–That was a while ago. We're still friends.</p></em><br>

<p>Pat looked down at a loose thread hanging from his pillow.</p><br>

<p><em>–Well, if you don't know they’re there, you can barely see them.<br>
–You're a liar. It’s hideous. Dana told me last week that I had the arm of a mental person.<br>
–Don't listen to Dana. It’s not that bad. Seriously.</em></p><br>

<p>Mary kissed him, bounced up from the bed, and asked if he wanted anything to drink. He said no and grinned at the thread.</p><br>

<p>Brenton Wood sang:</p><br>

<em><p>They fly away to a far off land<br>
And live a life that's really grand</p></em>
