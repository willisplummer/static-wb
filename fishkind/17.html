    <p>He could hear footsteps approaching the desk. He looked up, ―Do you know where I can find information on this textbook, handing him a slip of paper with a title.</p><div id='tab'>
<p>
―Um, like, where to find it?</p>
<p>
―Yeah, I mean, how can I take this out of the library?</p>
<p>
―You, uh, there’s a bunch of computers over there. You can look up the location in the catalog online. It’s the homepage.</p>
<p>
―I don’t really know how to do that. I’ve never checked a book out here before.</p>
<p>
―You just, you type this title in, the head bobbing before him. ―And it should bring up whether or not we have any copies.</p>
<p> 
―Oh. Okay.</p>
<p>
―…</p>
<p>
―…</p>
<p>
―Do you want me to search this for you?</p>
<p>
―Well not, like, I mean…</p>
<p>
―I’m happy to, like, run a search for you if you’re unfamiliar with the system.</p>
<p>
―Yeah, I mean, that’s great, but like, do you think there’s a way I could, like, try to rent this?</p>
<p>
―We can loan it to you if we have a copy, yes…</p>
<p>
―But I mean, see, the bookstore is out of it and I, like, sort of need it for a while to study for midterms and…</p>
<p>
―You can check it out if we have a…</p>
<p>
―Just if that’s possible, if somehow I could, like, just buy it for the semester and then maybe sell it back to you?</p>
<p>
―I’m pretty sure no…</p>
<p>
―No, but I mean, like what if I can just have a, like, extended loan.</p>
<p>
―You can already have it unless another student…</p>
<p>
―Oh, oh, yeah that’s cool. Yeah, let’s do it like that.</p>
<p>
―Requests it, in which case you have a two-week window before it’s due.</p>
<p>
―…</p>
<p>
―Is that okay?</p>
<p>
―What?</p>
<p>
―Do you want me to look this book up for you?</p>
<p>
―Oh… I thought you already did.</p>
<p>
―No, I’ve just been. Let me just… It appears somebody else actually has this title checked out.</p>
<p>
―What do you mean?</p>
<p>
―We only have one copy of the textbook. Probably, like, another one of your classmates…</p>
<p>
―No, like, because we were supposed to buy the book. Like I’m pretty sure everyone has the book. For me, though, I didn’t know we couldn’t just get a PDF online, so I didn’t, like, get one before the bookstore returned their extra copies to the publisher. So I just need to take this one if that’s all right.</p>
<p>―No, but see, it’s been checked out. I can tell you the call number, but it’s currently not in the library.</p>
<p>
―Unless the person like has it with them in the library? Or maybe they returned it today, like, can you check that?</p>
<p>
―I don’t take care of returns.</p>
<p>
―It should, like, be in the system, isn’t it?</p>
<p>
	―Not… Not here, not yet.</p>
<p>
	―So like what am I supposed to do?</p>
<p>
	―Would you like to request it from the current holder?</p>
<p>
	―Um…</p>
<p>
	―Then it would be guaranteed for pickup within two weeks.</p>
<p>
	―But my midterm’s the day after tomorrow.</p>
<p>
	―I don’t really know what to…</p>
<p>
	―You’re sure they don’t have it. It’s not, like, a system error?</p>
<p>
	―It’s been checked out.</p>
<p>
	―Can you give me the location, if I want to, like, go look to see if it’s there.</p>
<p>
	―Okay, are you ready?</p>
<p>
	―…</p>
<p>
―Q, B, nine eighty-one, point J two seven four.</p>
<p>
―Um, could you write that down. He wrote the call number on a piece from a pile of scrap paper in front of the student, sliding it back to him without eye contact. He navigated to Facebook, where he discovered a new notification. Someone had invited him to like a page, a band, the person’s band. He could see the student still hesitating over his workspace, staring at the piece of paper. Held closer as if a change in perspective might decode his idiocy. ―Uh, sorry, but, like, can you tell me exactly where this is?</p>
<p>
―Ninth floor, without looking up.</p>
<p>
―Um, where?</p>
<p>
―The ninth floor.</p>
<p>
―Oh… He moved slowly away.</p>
