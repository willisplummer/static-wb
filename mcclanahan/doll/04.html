    <p>I still wasn’t sure if I was going to do it or not, even after I told my mom about it when I got home.<br><br>
She laughed and thought it was a great idea.<br><br>
“Oh gracious Scott. That’s such a great idea. You guys will be the cutest things there.” Before I knew it we were in the bedroom and she was getting out a pair of her old pantyhose. Then she was getting out one of her maternity dresses and clipping the bottom of it. Before I knew it I was wearing this pair of pantyhose, and I was wearing my mom’s ratty dress. We laughed and looked in the mirror just like when I was a little boy and she dressed me up like a girl before my dad came home.<br><br>
We looked in the mirror and she put the lipstick on me and then two big red spots on my cheeks.<br><br>
“Oh Scott you look so cute,” she said and handed me one of my baby rattles.   
She put a bow in my hair and said, “Do you feel cute?</p>
