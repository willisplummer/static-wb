    <p>And it was just like the way he cussed god when we were trying to put in the waterline outside our house, and it wouldn’t stop raining.  It was a ditch of mud.<br><br>

So we picked up the trash and put it into the trash bag, and my Dad put the trash bag on top of the can and then he went off to work.<br><br>

But then the next week it happened all over again. And then the next week it happened again. There was trash strewn throughout ourbackyard for the whole week. There were old tissues, and my Mom’s maxi pads, the hair from where she cleaned out the hair brush, and a bunch of empty Moore’s potato chip bags. It’s still the greatest potato chip ever invented. Dad said he was going to get that “shitten ass possum” and then we’d see. But then the next week it happened all over again. And so I imagined the old possum, far away on a mountaintop, getting fat from our trash and getting even with my Dad.  He was showing him something.</p>
