    But it wasn’t over. Three weeks later my Dad woke up to go to work and there was trash scattered all over our back yard. I guess we must have left a garbage bag sitting beside the trash cans and now there was shit scattered everywhere.<br><br>
    My Dad knew it was “that damn possum.”He got me out of bed, and I helped pick up all of the wet trash scattered everywhere. And there were old cottage cheese containers, and there was old gnawed up popsicle sticks, and empty ice cream sandwich boxes, and wet crusts of lumpy bread like an old sponge. So I walked outside into the back yard and it was still dark and I helped pick it all up and put it in the trash can. And then I listened to my Dad cuss the possum just like he cussed the seagull who shit on his head at the beach that time.  Birds are so stupid.<br><br>

He was always fighting things.</p>
