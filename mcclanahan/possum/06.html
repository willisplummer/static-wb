    <p><b>3.</b><br><br>
    One morning I was getting ready to go to football practice.  It was still dark outside. And my Dad was getting ready to go to work.  We heard something.<br><br>

I was eating my oatmeal, and we heard the trash cans bumping against each other. These weren’t the new plastic garbage cans, but these were the old metal trash cans.  These were the canswith the rusty holes in the bottom you could see through.<br><br>

My Dad heard the trash cans clanging together and he said, “Damn possums,” and walked out to the door. I asked if it was the possum. And then I followed him. There was this possum digging into a garbage bag, sitting beside the trash cans. And there was only a skinny little possum tail sticking out of the bag.<br><br>

My Dad reached down and grabbed the tail and said, “Damn possum.” It was him.</p>
